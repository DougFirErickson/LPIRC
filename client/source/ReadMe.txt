"golden_output.csv" is a file containing list of bounding box information
which correspond to the images in the server.

This file is being used to simulate the recognition program the
participant will have during the competition. This is just sample data
to check if the interface with the server is working properly.

The participant should generate this data by running the recognition software
on the images sent by the server.
